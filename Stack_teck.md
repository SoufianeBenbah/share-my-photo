# Stack tech of the project

## Database

### Why no SQL ? 

* The pace of development with NoSQL databases can be much faster than with a SQL database.
* The structure of many different forms of data is more easily handled and evolved with a NoSQL database.
* NoSQL databases are often based on a scale-out strategy, which makes scaling to large data volumes much cheaper than when using the scale-up approach the SQL databases take.

### What are the features and benefits of using MongoDB in this project ?

Using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) can provide many benefits to a software development team. Its flexible schema makes it easy to evolve and store data in a way that is easy for programmers to work with. MongoDB is also built to scale up quickly and supports all the main features of modern databases such as transactions and GridFs which is a specification of storing and retrieving files that exceed the BSON-document size limit of 16MB. Additionally, MongoDB has a large community of users that can provide help.

## Server side

### Why Node.js ? 
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is an open source, a server-side script which runs on the top of Googleâ€™s open-source scripting engine V8. Node.js is fast, lightweight and efficient.
* It uses the asynchronous mode of operation, event-driven Input/output rather than using the traditional threads or separate threads for each process.
* 43% of Node.js programmers claim to use Node.js for enterprise apps.
* Node.js has a set of built-in modules which can be used without any further installation.

### Node.js in our project 

Our application needs to be compatible with multiple devices, node.js provides cross-platform applications which run easily on any web. It increases the efficiency of the development process as it fills the gap between frontend and backend applications.

## Client side

### Why Angular ?

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is an Open Source JavaScript Framework based on TypeScript, Developed by Google for web development. With growing popularity and demand for Single Page Applications, Angular was picked up quickly and adapted.

Angular is a TypeScript based web development framework, preferred for big applications though it works fine for small applications. Support and love given by the web development community have helped Angular grow fast and being adopted quickly.
